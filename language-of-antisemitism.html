When David Irving spouted »I don’t think there was any overall Reich policy to kill the Jews«, he was internationally condemned – and thus failed to change public discourse; so antisemites who <em>do</em> want to influence public debate have to disguise their language: for example, they might criticise Israel, using anti-Zionism as a Trojan horse to bring in antisemitism.</p><p>[Look in the white notebook for a bit more on this…]</p></root>
