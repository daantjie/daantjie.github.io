◊section{preparing for death: the ◊foreign{memento mori} tradition}

Langley remarks that his work focuses entirely around gloomy topics – suicide,
plague, death, etc. – with regard to Shakespeare.

◊quotation[#:person "Frank Kermode" #:source "The Sense of An Ending: Studies in
the Theory of Fiction"]{Men, like poets, rush ‘into the middest,’ ◊italic{in
medias res}, when they are born; they also die ◊italic{in mediis rebus}, and to
make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such
as give meaning to lives and to poems.}

In narrative, everything has a beginning and an end, linked together in a great
causal chain – yet real life often doesn't feel like this.

◊quotation[#:person "Michael Neill"]{Narrative offers to put a form
on the inchoate matter of experience…}

Despite our fear of death, we love crime thrillers and detective novels, because
in these deaths we find a meaning and a cause – the victim died for a
◊emph{reason} – and we can blame the death on the perpetrator. The genre allows
us to solve death.

In this sense, Hamlet is, weirdly, slightly relieved to find that Claudius
murdered his father, because it means his father's death wasn't merely random or
◊quoted{common} – it had a significance.

◊quotation[#:person "Michael Neill" #:source "Issues of Death: Mortality and
Identity in English Renaissance Tragedy"]{Death has two guises in
◊italic{Hamlet}: it is both dreaded and longed for; it is that which renders
life senseless, and that which completes and makes sense of life; it is at once
end-as-termination and end-as-purpose, ◊italic{finis} and ◊italic{telos}.}

◊quotation[#:person "Walter Raleigh" #:source "History of the World"]{It is
therefore death alone that can suddenly make a man to know himself.}
