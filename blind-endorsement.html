    <root><h1>A condemnation of blind endorsement</h1><div class="quotation"><div>«<sc>Common Lisp</sc> is … by far the best programming environment available to current-day programmers.»</div><div style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>Doug Hoyte in ‘Let Over Lambda’</em></div></div><p>Saying something over and over again doesn’t make it any more true.</p><p>It’s not helpful, when you want to show people the interesting parts of Lisp, to call it the <span>‘ultimate language’</span>. Like anything, Lisp has upsides and downsides. If you’re someone who likes Lisp, (I hope) it’s not because people have <em>told</em> you it’s great – rather, it’s because you’ve spent time with it, you’ve created things with it, and you’ve decided that its pros outweigh its cons.<span class="sidenote">Or that <function>cons</function> is its best pro!</span></p><p>This is perhaps a more general point about making good arguments: that you should give people the facts so they come to their own conclusion. Stuffing your prose with zealous rhetoric doesn’t make the facts more factual – it just hides the real, honest truth from the reader.</p><p>This method of persuasion is called <em>logos</em>. It’s one of <person>Aristotle</person>’s <em>three modes of persuasion</em><span class="sidenote">Though it turns out that there is a fourth, <em>kairos</em>, which is where the orator uses the time and the setting to their advantage – however, this isn’t key to <em>written</em> arguments.</span>, and Aristotle describes it not just as the logic behind an argument, but also as giving a satisfaction to the listeners, who are given the freedom to make their own conclusions.</p></root>
