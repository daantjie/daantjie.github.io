  <root><h1>A con­dem­na­tion of blind en­dorse­ment</h1><p><div class="quotation"><div>«<sc>Com­mon Lisp</sc> is … by far the best pro­gram­ming en­vi­ron­ment avail­able to cur­rent-day pro­gram­mers.»</div><div style="padding-left: 2em;"><i>Doug Hoyte in Let Over Lamb­da</i></div></div></p><p>Say­ing some­thing over and over again doesn’t make it any more true.</p><p>It’s not help­ful, when you want to show peo­ple the in­ter­est­ing parts of Lisp, to call it the <span>‘ul­ti­mate lan­guage’</span>. Like any­thing, Lisp has up­sides and down­sides. If you’re some­one who likes Lisp, (I hope) it’s not be­cause peo­ple have <i>told</i> you it’s great – rather, it’s be­cause you’ve spent time with it, you’ve cre­at­ed things with it, and you’ve de­cid­ed that its pros out­weigh its cons.<span class="sidenote">Or that <i>cons</i> is its best pro!</span></p><p>This is per­haps a more gen­er­al point about mak­ing good ar­gu­ments: that you should give peo­ple the facts so they come to their own con­clu­sion. Stuff­ing your prose with zeal­ous rhetoric doesn’t make the facts more fac­tu­al – it just hides the real, hon­est truth from the read­er.</p><p>This method of per­sua­sion is called <em>lo­gos</em>. It’s one of <person>Aris­to­tle</person>’s <em>three modes of per­sua­sion</em><span class="sidenote">Though it turns out that there is a fourth, <em>kairos</em>, which is where the or­a­tor uses the time and the set­ting to their ad­van­tage – how­ev­er, this isn’t key to <i>writ­ten</i> ar­gu­ments.</span>, and Aris­to­tle de­scribes it not just as the log­ic be­hind an ar­gu­ment, but also as giv­ing a sat­is­fac­tion to the lis­ten­ers, who are giv­en the free­dom to make their own con­clu­sions.</p></root>
