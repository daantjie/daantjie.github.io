◊title{The Language of Antisemitism}

◊quotation[#:person "Ms Cheetham" #:source "a disscussion of Frisch's ‘Andorra’"]{
What are Jews traditionally known to be? … Yeah, greedy.}

I am very conscious that quoting my German teacher in text doesn't capture the
ponderous, careful tone in which she spoke those words; and I am in no doubt
that she is not an antisemite, as she made that clear in the discussion that
followed – but doesn't stripping away the tone force us to look at the words
and what they really imply?

Explicit antisemitism is unacceptable in public discourse. When David Irving
spouted »I don't think there was any overall Reich policy to kill the Jews«, he
was internationally condemned – and thus failed to change public discourse; so
antisemites who ◊emph{do} want to influence public debate have to disguise
their language: for example, they might criticise Israel, using anti-Zionism as
a Trojan horse to bring in antisemitism.
