    <root><h1>Shakespeare’s mortal anxieties</h1><p><i>Notes on a lecture by Dr Eric Langley at the Friends Meeting House in London, 23 November 2017</i></p><p><i>Daniel Antwn Ioan Oosthuizen</i></p><h2>preparing for death: the <foreign>memento mori</foreign> tradition</h2><p>Langley remarks that his work focuses entirely around gloomy topics – suicide, plague, death, etc. – with regard to Shakespeare.</p><div class="quotation"><div>«Men, like poets, rush ‘into the middest,’ <i>in medias res</i>, when they are born; they also die <i>in mediis rebus</i>, and to make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems.»</div><div style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>Frank Kermode in ‘The Sense of An Ending: Studies in
the Theory of Fiction’</em></div></div><p>In narrative, everything has a beginning and an end, linked together in a great causal chain – yet real life often doesn’t feel like this.</p><div class="quotation"><div>«Narrative offers to put a form on the inchoate matter of experience…»</div><div style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>Michael Neill</em></div></div><p>Despite our fear of death, we love crime thrillers and detective novels, because in these deaths we find a meaning and a cause – the victim died for a <em>reason</em> – and we can blame the death on the perpetrator. The genre allows us to solve death.</p><p>In this sense, Hamlet is, weirdly, slightly relieved to find that Claudius murdered his father, because it means his father’s death wasn’t merely random or <quoted>common</quoted> – it had a significance.</p><div class="quotation"><div>«Death has two guises in <i>Hamlet</i>: it is both dreaded and longed for; it is that which renders life senseless, and that which completes and makes sense of life; it is at once end-as-termination and end-as-purpose, <i>finis</i> and <i>telos</i>.»</div><div style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>Michael Neill in ‘Issues of Death: Mortality and
Identity in English Renaissance Tragedy’</em></div></div><div class="quotation"><div>«It is therefore death alone that can suddenly make a man to know himself.»</div><div style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>Walter Raleigh in ‘History of the World’</em></div></div><h2>death defiance: <name>Macbeth</name></h2></root>
